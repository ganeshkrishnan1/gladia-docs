# Developer guide for beginners on contributing to UnifAI

## Librairies

Most external libraries are embedded in the project in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jqueguiner/unifai-apis-core/blob/main/api/requirements.txt) file. The main packages are also embedded in the [Docker base image](https://github.com/jqueguiner/unifai-apis-core/blob/main/api/gpu.Dockerfile.full).

In general for a developper needing a custom librairy it's recommended to add it to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/jqueguiner/unifai-apis-core/blob/main/api/requirements.txt) file.
