# Build your first AI APP

## General rule

Creating your first API start with the qualification of the type of problem you are solving.

* [ ] Define your INPUT type (Image / Sound / Text / Video)
* [ ] Define your OUTPUT type (Image / Sound / Text / Video)
* [ ] Define the task you are solving within this INPUT/OUTPUT combination
  * [ ] You can check the list of INPUT / OUTPUT / TASK combinations [here](input-ouput-tasks.md).

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
