UnifAI is Fast and easy to deploy AI APIs framework.

It has been designed to help researchers compare their qualitative results against other models for a given task.

On the other hand it has been designed with a web developper as a end user in mind. Making sure developper with no/low AI knowledge can leverage AI new capabilities in a few minutes.

## Features

* All AI APIs in one place.
* No AI skills needed to leverage AI capabilities such as :
  * Speech to Text / Speech recognition
  * Optical Character Recognition
  * Speech Generation
  * Translation
  * Auto-correct
  * Next word prediction
  * Nudity Detection (NSFW)
  * Language Abuse Detection
  * and many others
  * Check our extensive list of [implemented AI tasks](aipi-basics/input-ouput-tasks.md) available with APIs
* AI API curation : selecting and implementing models out of the box.
* AI API harmonization making sure that all implementation remain consistent whatever the model is.
* Auto Data Type conversion (Input and output).
* Lighting Fast new API integration requiring low API skills.
* 1 line Docker Deployment leverage GPU's power.
* No dependency nightmare.
* No Driver/CUDA/CuDNN/Tensorflow/Pytorch compatibility nightmare.
